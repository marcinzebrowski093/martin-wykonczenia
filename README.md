This is a project which I am working on recently

It is not finished but I am proud of it already. It is only my second project but thanks to my lovely wife who is making graphics for this, helping me with the design it looks really sharp.

Once again I got inspired by youtube developers and decided to make a website for my business, the research part was easy this time because I know what I want :)

It will be written fully in plain html/css/js.

After this project I want to make a start-up with my friend in React. Stay tuned :)
